#### Hardware: 
    It is physical hardware that includes items such as Mouse, Keyboard, Display, CPU etc.,
#### Kernel:
    It is the core component of the Linux Operating System. It is responsible to execute our commands and interact with hardware components. Its main function Memory Managemen, Process Management, Device Management, Storage Management etc.,
#### Shell:
    It is the outer layer of the Linux operating system. It acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. Shell will read commands which we have typed. It will check whether the command is proper or not. It also checks syntax. If the command is valid then it will interpret that command into kernel understandable form and handover it over to the kernel.
    There are a few types of these shells which are categorized as follows:
### Korn shell
### Bourne shell
### C shell
### POSIX shell
#### Application:
    This is the topmost layer of the Linux architecture.It consists of the various applications that run on the operating system. These can be anything from text editors, software and games to web browsers and media players.
    
# Command Execution Flow

![End user will type command in terminal eg  mkdir test (1)](https://github.com/Parimal-Pradhan/DevOps_Project_2023/assets/86794999/f238e2db-24d3-4ebb-8d7d-131c55eb0c4e)

#### /bin:
      bin contains binary executables related to commands used by a normal user.
#### /sbin:
      It contains all binary executables related to high-end admin (superuser OR root) commands. Eg: Disk partitioning, network management etc.bin contains binary executables related to commands used by a superuser.
#### /etc:
      This directory contains all system configuration files.
#### /tmp:
      It contains all temporary files.
#### /dev: 
      It contains device node files.
#### /mnt:
      Mount point for temporarily mounting a filesystem.
#### /media: 
     Mount point for removable media devices.
#### /opt:
     opt means optionally. This directory contains all third-party software installation files.
#### /lib: 
     lib means library. It contains Linux os libraries which are required by our commands and applications.
#### /var:
     var means variable data. It stores log files.
#### /home: 
     It stores each user's data. data can be images, files etc.,
#### /proc: 
     It stores data related to currently running processes.
